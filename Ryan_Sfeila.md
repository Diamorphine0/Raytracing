At this stage, computation of facing ratio at each hitpoint (for shading/Lambertian reflectance later) and computation of reflected ray.
Next step, recursively evaluate reflected rays up to reflection depth to determine pixel color.
After: Determine reflection paramters for materials, refraction, optimize code (adapt to mesh structure.)
