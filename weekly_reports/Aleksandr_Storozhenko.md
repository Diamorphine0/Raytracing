Week 1:
-
- Organized first team meeting; As a result, we have adopted a 2 team approach (members evenly split between the Engine and the Raytracing Component). Outlined the project objectives ... 
- Implemented a simple OpenGL window with ability to render verticies 
- Implemented a simple camera to navigate the scene

Week 2:
-

Week 3:

Week 4:

Week 5:
- 
- Abstraction of rendering event loop (Completed the engine camera class)
- Abstracton of the openGL library code (Through the definition of Vertex, VB, VA, & Entity classes)
- Created the Scene Graph Class (Refer to the node class)
- Added simple animation functionality
- Merged with raytracing part (Task completed with Tudor Ivan - leader of the raytracing team)

Week 6:
-
- Animation through linear interpolation between keyframes
- Implementation of Textures and Lighting (Helping Marcel to fix the bugs and connect it to the engine functionality) + (Rewrote the code to fit the codebase style - abstracted textures into classes, etc ...).
- Object picking
- Frame buffer loading

Week 7:
- 
- Connecting engine and raytracing functionality to the UI
- Implemented the animation functionality in the UI (Ability to create, modify, and edit keyframes; Run the engine animation with an animation bar; etc)
- Assisted in the final merge with the raytracing part (Task completed with Tudor Ivan - Leader of the raytracing team).
- Merged across multiple engine side branches, connecting the implemented functionality (i.e object loading and transforms) ( Task completed with Marcel Chwialkowski ).
- Fixed multiple bugs found in the code (hanging nullptrs, inconsistent naming, circular library loading)
