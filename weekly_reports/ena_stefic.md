Weekly report

Week 1: I moved the raytracing camera from the main class to its own class. At the moment, it has two functions: constructing rays and rendering the image.

Week 2: I made the camera positionable. We can now specify a viewport and tilt the camera.

Week 4: I implemented antialiasing by sending multiple rays to a square surrounding a given pixel for more accurate rendering.

Week 5: I added the defocus blur effect. Not all rays originate at the center of the camera but at a disk centered at the camera's center.

Week 7: After the changes in the project I had to reimplement positioning of the raytracing camera.
